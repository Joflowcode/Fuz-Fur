            <p>That's unfortunate. This year we finally got our hands on some vertical cell phone camera footage and some vintage antique movie theatre bootlegs..from the back row!
                Some of them even have heads in the way blocking the screen for a truly submersive experience.

                But if fine art is not your forte, we send you off with well wishes and hope you find something you enjoy.
