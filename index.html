            <p>"When I first looked at the picture, the cat's eyes hit me with the impact of Mona Lisa's smile.
                It brought up all sorts of feelings and I felt in that moment like I almost understood the secrets
                of the universe. That's how compelling it was. Later I found out the it wasn't the cat's eyes but
                maybe their nose and a streetlight, or the moon, I don't know. Impossible to be able to tell because of
                the advanced unsteady hands and finger partially covering the camera technique. It didn't matter, all
                I knew was that getting it for $1,000,000 was an incredible value." ~ Customer Review </p>
